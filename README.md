# OASIS-Challenge-Baseline-Code-and-Models
This is the baseline code and models for the OASIS Challenge

The OASIS baseline precompiled binaries folder contains executables and several example builds.
As documented in the quick-start guide, users will need to download the free Slic3r package from www.slic3r.org and unpack it into the empty slic3r folder

Each of the four examples applies a single scan strategy to each part, per the Region Profile tab of the configuration file

OASIS baseline source code contains code for layer and scan file generation which performs all functions except for STL-file slicing (as handled by a call to slic3r.exe).  See the documentation folder within the source folder for more information on the code, its intent, capabilities and limitations

What to do...
1.) Clone or download the files in this repository.
2.) Thoroughly review the OASIS Challenge Documentation_202000821.docx.
3.) Thoroughly review all the documentation contained within the file folders.
4.) Happy Coding!!
